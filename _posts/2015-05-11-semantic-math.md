> Formalism eliminates falsehood;  it does not lead to the truth.

0.  Lists should be numbered from zero.

1.  Tell the truth, not formal statements.  Formal definitons are important,
but they are not the essense of mathematics.  What the notion really means is
much more important than how it appears.

2.  Motivation is important.  One should know why that particular structure is
studied before they actually studies them.  For example, the idea of symmetry
should come before the concept of groups.

3.  Avoid preliminaries.  Better, transform preliminaries into motivating
applications.  At times, preliminaries can be embedded into the text, e.g.,
Homological Algebra can (and should) be taught along with Topological Homology
Theory.  Sometimes, the “preliminary” can be developed together with the main
topic, as is the case with ODE and Newtonian Mechanics, Differential Geometry
and Hamiltonian Mechanics, Riemannian Geometry and the Theory of General
Relativity, Linear Algebra and Quantum Mechanics, etc.
